Class 1

Statistical procedures as robots: input/output. How to apply them to real complex problems is non-trivial. May be used wrongly. They are blind to creator's intent. Non binary: in the sense that a model is not true/false. "All models are wrong, but some of them are useful"

Hipothesis vs Process Models vs Statistical models 

Scientific models are intrisically causal/generative on how things happen. Statistical models care about association, not causation. Same statistical model may be associated with more than one process model, each belonging to a different hipothesis.


When running examples:

1. Understand theoretical estimand
2. Scientific causal model
3. User 1 and 2 to build statistical model
4. Simulate form 2 to validate 3 yields 1
5. Analyze real data

Real problem: connect causal models to statistical procedures.

"No causes in, no causes on": we can't infer causes from data.

Design an study <> causal inference.

Causation: is prediction of intervention or inputation of missing values (two ways of thinking about it).

Correlation doesn't imply causation, causation doesn't imply correlation.



Class 2

- Posterior distribution encodes uncertainty
- Prior predictive encodes a causal model
- Posterior predictive likewise.

- Fiting mechanism is part of the model.

Chapter 3:

Compatibility interval: two parameters whose interval contains certain amount of probability mass
Percentile intervals: assign equal probability mass to each tail
Highest posterior density interval.

Usages of simulations: model design, research design, software testing, model checking and forecasting.
